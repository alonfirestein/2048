# 2048 Game

This was a small fun project of mine and to try and improve my python skills.
In this project I built the popular [2048](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)) game.  
The rules are very simple if you don't already know them, you can read more click the link above, or you can learn them down below real quick.


# Running the program:  
Clone this repository to your current working directory:
`git clone https://github.com/alonfirestein/2048.git`
  
Open your terminal and navigate to the directory the repository is at and run the program using the python command:
  
For Mac/Linux users:  `python3 __init__.py`  
  
For Windows users: `__init__.py`


# Game Rules:  
  
The rules are very simple. You just need to move the tiles (using the arrow keys on your keyboard) and every time you move one, another tile pops up in a random manner anywhere in the grid. When two tiles with the same number on them collide with one another as you move them, they will merge into one tile with the sum of the numbers written on them initially. 
  
The goal of the game is to reach the tile with 2048 on it.  
If you fail to properly merge the tiles every time you make a move using the keyboard, that means more tiles will pop up. Therefore once the whole grid fills up with tiles and there are no possible ways to connect any two adjacents tiles, that means you lose the game.
  
Please try it out and enjoy!




# Example:
  
Below is a video taken when running the game, the direction of the blocks are moved using the arrow keys on your keyboard.
